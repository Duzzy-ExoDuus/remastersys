Remastersys allows you to remaster your system, creating a backup image or a new
distribution that can be burned and run as a Live CD/DVD.

USAGE:

    remastersys [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
        (must run as superuser)

COMMAND:

    backup   - creates a backup of your system in a Live CD/DVD.
    
    dist     - creates a distribution of your system in a Live CD/DVD.
    
    clean    - cleans the temporary files created by remastersys.
    
    install  - installs Live CD/DVD to hard disk.
    
    skelcopy - copies an user personal settings to the /etc/skel folder.
    
    grub     - installs or restores GRUB bootloader.

OPTIONS:

    backup
    dist
    
        These options are really optional.
    
            cdfs        - Creates the CD file system only. This option is
                          designed to be used if you want to modify something on
                          the CD before creating the ISO. An example would be
                          modifying the isolinux portion of Live CD/DVD.
            
            iso         - Creates an ISO image as long as the CD file system has
                          already been created.
            
            filename    - Name of the image file to be created. If the given
                          file name has no ".iso" extension, then it will be
                          added automatically. If this parameter is not
                          provided, the ISO will be saved as
                          "remastersys-livecd.iso".
    
    clean
    
        Has no options.
        
    install
    
        If no option is provided installer will run in a terminal using "dialog"
        as user interface.
    
            -g, --gui   - runs installer with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
                          created in "yad".
        
    skelcopy
    
        You must use either option, but you must use at least one.
    
            username    - is a valid user on the system. Copies "username"
                          personal settings to the /etc/skel folder.
        
            clear       - deletes all contents of /etc/skel and restores default
                          Debian's files.
        
    grub
    
        -c, --config    - Installs GRUB bootloader. You must provide both options
                          bellow.
    
            device
            
                Either the full path of a device or it's mounting point.
                Partition must have been mounted previously.
                
                    /dev/device      - Ex.: /dev/sda1.
                    
                    /mounting/point  - Ex.: /mnt/sda1, if /dev/sda1 is mounted
                                       there.
        
            location
            
                Where to install GRUB. You have two choices:
        
                    root    - install GRUB to root partition.
            
                    rootmbr - install to MBR. Default when location is omitted.

        -r, --restore   - Restores GRUB bootloader. Only works if the package
                          "remastersys-gui" is installed.

EXAMPLES:

    remastersys backup
        (creates a Live CD/DVD containing a backup of your system)

    remastersys backup custom
        (creates a Live CD/DVD backup, and names the ISO as "custom.iso")

    remastersys dist
        (creates a Live CD/DVD containing a distribution of your system)

    remastersys dist cdfs
        (creates only the file system of yours Live CD/DVD distribution)

    remastersys dist iso custom.iso
        (creates an ISO of the distribution with the name custom.iso, as long as
        the file system has already been created)

    remastersys clean
        (deletes the working folder "/home/remastersys")
    
    remastersys install
        (installs Live CD/DVD to hard disk using dialog as user interface)
    
    remastersys install -g
        (installs Live CD/DVD to hard disk using a GUI)
    
    remastersys skelcopy daniel
        (copies user "daniel" personal settings to the /etc/skel folder)
    
    remastersys skelcopy clear
        (deletes all contents of /etc/skel and restores default Debian's files)
    
    remastersys grub /dev/sda1
    remastersys grub /dev/sda1 rootmbr
    remastersys grub /mnt/sda1
    remastersys grub /mnt/sda1 rootmbr
        (if /dev/sda1 is mounted on /mnt/sda1 all these commands will install
        GRUB to MBR of /dev/sda)
    
    remastersys grub /dev/sda1 root
        (if /dev/sda1 is mounted on /mnt/sda1 this command will install GRUB to
        partition /dev/sda1)
