REMASTERSYS INSTALLER
=====================

No Warranty is provided with this installer or remastersys in general.

It is a GUI or TEXT MODE installer that only uses up to 3 partitions: 1 for the
root filesystem, 1 optional for /home and 1 for swap.

The swap partition will be automatically formatted and both the root and /home
filesystems will be formatted as ext2, ext3 or ext4 based on selection.

A single user will be created on the new system unless installing a backup,
which may contain more users.

It runs cfdisk for partitioning unless you run GUI in which case it uses
gparted.
