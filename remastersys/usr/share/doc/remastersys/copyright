REMASTERSYS

    Is a tool to remaster your system. It can make a full system backup or a
    distributable copy.

HISTORY:

    Originally created by Tony "Fragadelic" Brijeski on February 12, 2007.
    Last version released was 3.0.0 on January 11, 2013.
    
    Forked by Daniel Dias Rodrigues (aka "Nerun") on September 8, 2021. But I've
    been working on Remastersys since October 9, 2013, when I created my first
    fork, called "ReFiSeFuQui" (acronym for something like "remasters made over
    the weekend in a garage"). Much of that code has been reused in this new
    fork.
