### KNOWN BUGS

* There may be many bugs that I am unaware of...

### THINGS TO DO

* Needed tests:
   * remastersys-grubconfig and remastersys-grub-restore
   * remastersys-skelcopy: need to know if the user's personal settings are actually being used.
* manpages:
   * add remastersys-grubconfig, -installer and -skelcopy
   * create manpages to remastersys-gui, -grub-restore and -usb-key-copy-tool
* Issues:
   * [Add EFI / UEFI boot support](#3)
   * [Remove 4 GB ISO limitation](#2)
