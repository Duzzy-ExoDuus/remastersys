# DEVELOPER NOTES

### KNOWN BUGS

* ...

### THINGS TO DO

* new libraries:
   * add libremastersysgui.sh to remastersys-installer
* needed tests:
   * remastersys-skelcopy: need to know if the user's personal settings are actually being used.
* remastersys-gui unified help
   * _not started_, but should i move "grub --restore" to remastersys-gui unified help? Probably yes.
* manpages:
   * add remastersys-grubconfig, -installer and -skelcopy
   * create manpages to remastersys-gui, -grub-restore and -bootable-usb
   * after unified help manpages are really needed?
* Issues:
   * [Add EFI / UEFI boot support](https://github.com/nerun/remastersys/issues/3)
